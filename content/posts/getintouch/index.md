If you'd like to connect with other cloud-native enthusiasts so let's join our <a href="https://slack.cloudnativeprague.cz/">Slack</a> or #cloud-native-prague channel in <a href="https://cloud-native.slack.com/">CNCF Slack</a>.

Do you spent more time in cloud than in the human realm? Would you like to share your successes/screw-ups/experience with cloud native tools? How about joining us at a meetup, where we can discuss cloud-native stuff. And don't worry, there's no need to dust off that old suit or tuxedo. :party-parrot:

Of course you can attend even if you are not currently developing, migrating, deploying or whatevering to cloud. Everything you need is passion for cloud and cloud-native technologies that exists for pushing you forward.

Wait, you are still reading? Then maybe you would like to talk at the next meetup or even be so generous and help us with organizing meetups â€“ sponsorships and hosting is welcome. Let us know via <a href="https://involvement.cloudnativeprague.cz/">Google form</a>.

Records from meetups are available at our <a href="https://records.cloudnativeprague.cz/">Youtube</a> channel, slides at our <a href="https://slides.cloudnativeprague.cz/">GitHub</a>.

TL;DR: we like cloud, come hang out with us at meetup
