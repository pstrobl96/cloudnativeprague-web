We have been running Cloud Native Prague for more than a year. It's not easy to prepare events for you, the community, but honestly it's great in the end. We've had a lot of amazing speakers talking about things they're interested in, discussing things with you, and of course answering numerous questions. 

However, without you, it would be an empty shell. We put on a lot of amazing events, if you want to see how it went, you can go to the <a href="https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-prague/">CNCF</a> page for a list of our past events.
